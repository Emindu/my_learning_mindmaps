### Physical and Mental Health Impacts
- **Stress and Agitation**: Chronic stress can lead to depression, obsessions, suicidal ideation, and in some cases, delusions and hallucinations.
- **Neurological Changes**: The limbic system becomes hyperactive, while the prefrontal cortex may shrink, affecting reasoning, memory, and cognition.
- **Physical Symptoms**: Heart palpitations, headaches, dizziness, hypersensitivity, weight loss due to digestive issues, and poor appetite.

### Psychological Impacts
- **Emotional Instability**: Loss of sense of identity and reality, leading to anxiety, rage, and irrational actions.
- **Sleep Disturbances**: Difficulty sleeping and losing sense of time.

### Coping Mechanisms
- Establishing a routine with robust exercise, reading, and writing can help mitigate effects.

### Context of Solitary Confinement
- **Historical Use**: Introduced as an alternative to corporal punishment, but widely criticized for its negative effects.
- **Current Practices**: Still used in many US prisons, despite criticism and documented harm.
- **Long-Term Effects**: Difficulties readjusting to life outside prison, increased risk of PTSD, anxiety, paranoia, and concentration issues.`;
