## Roommate Chore Conflict Example
- Two roommates agree to split dishwashing duties weekly.
- One roommate repeatedly fails to do dishes on scheduled days.
- This creates a dilemma: whether to do dishes despite potential repeated burden or to allow pile-up, risking conflict.

## Introduction to Game Theory
- Game Theory studies decision-making where outcomes depend on others' choices.
- It models conflict and cooperation among rational decision-makers.
- It applies to social, economic, political interactions, from small groups to nations.
- Every decision can be represented mathematically to find optimal strategies.

## Types of Games in Game Theory
- **Cooperative games:** players share goals and resources (e.g., roommates, business partners).
- **Non-cooperative games:** players act independently to maximize their own benefit, possibly at others’ expense (more common in reality).

## Example: Golden Balls Game Show
- Players choose to split or steal a prize.
- Rational dominant strategy is always to steal despite potential cooperation benefits.
- Demonstrates how one-shot games often incentivize defection.

## Limitations of One-Off Game Models
- Real life involves repeated interactions, uncertainty, and ongoing consequences.
- Relationships and outcomes evolve over time.
- Strategic decisions matter differently in ongoing relationships than in isolated games.

## Axelrod’s Prisoner's Dilemma Tournaments (1980)
- Programs competed in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games (200 rounds or unknown number).
- Each round: cooperate or defect with specific payoffs.
- 14–62 strategies submitted, ranging from cooperative to cunning.

## Winning Strategy: Tit for Tat
- Starts by cooperating.
- Then copies opponent’s previous move.
- Responds to defection with defection but quickly forgives cooperation.
- Does not win single matches but has highest overall score.
- Success factors: niceness, retaliation, forgiveness, clarity.
- Generous versions that occasionally forgive defections perform even better.

## Insights and Implications
- Cooperation can emerge if interactions are repeated and future encounters expected.
- Being nice and cooperative is a strength, not a weakness.
- Forgiveness is important; holding grudges harms long-term success.
- Retaliation must be proportional, consistent, and clear.
- An "eye for an eye" approach (balanced justice) supports cooperation restoration.
- Real-world complexity adds challenges: emotional, informational, and multi-party factors.

## Broader Lessons
- Life’s interactions are "games" that require strategies blending cooperation and self-interest.
- Focusing solely on winning can lead to poor outcomes; openness to cooperation can lead to bigger wins.
- Consistent engagement and willingness to forgive promote long-term mutual benefit.
- Individual choices impact broader social and systemic outcomes.

## Closing Note
- Applying these lessons personally: do the dishes and engage cooperatively in everyday life interactions.
