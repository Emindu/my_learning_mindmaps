const noteMarkdown = `## Key Insights for People in Their 30s

- **Health Habits Matter More Than Ever**  
  The physical and mental resilience you enjoyed in your 20s fades; unhealthy choices (diet, sleep, stress, substances) that you “got away with” before will catch up to you.  
  The margin for error on neglecting your health narrows significantly—what you ignore now compounds problems later.

- **Consequences Compound**  
  Neglect and poor decisions (health, relationships, career) accumulate over time—problems don’t resolve themselves.  
  The longer you avoid difficult conversations or necessary changes, the harder they become to address.

- **Responsibility Can’t Be Outsourced**  
  Your choices, commitments, and accountability are yours alone—avoiding responsibility or making excuses calcifies into your identity if unchallenged.

## Relationships and Social Life

- **Marriage and Children Aren’t Fixes**  
  Rushing into major life steps to avoid difficult conversations or breakups only magnifies existing relationship issues.

- **Quality Over Quantity in Social Circles**  
  Your social life naturally shrinks; prioritize meaningful relationships over a large network.  
  Time becomes your most valuable resource—invest it in people and activities that truly matter.

## Career, Dreams, and Identity

- **Your Definition of Success Evolves**  
  Early dreams and goals may not align with reality—let go of dreams that no longer serve you.  
  The pursuit of external validation (career, possessions) does not lead to self-respect or happiness.

- **It’s Never Too Late to Change Course**  
  Your 30s offer the perspective to know what not to do, while still having time to build a meaningful life.

## Mental Growth and Maturity

- **Maturity Means Discomfort**  
  Being an adult requires the willingness to make unpopular choices and face difficult conversations.  
  Needing everyone’s approval is a sign of immaturity—growth comes from self-definition, even at the risk of disapproval.

- **Respect Is Built on Consistency**  
  Real respect comes from reliability and integrity, not material success or impressing others.

## Time and Energy Management

- **Burnout Comes From Misaligned Priorities**  
  Exhaustion stems from investing time in things that lack meaning—edit your commitments ruthlessly.

- **Time Is Your Most Precious Resource**  
  Appreciate the scarcity of time in your 30s; every year feels faster and more consequential.

## Final Advice

- **Act Now**  
  The longer you delay addressing issues (health, habits, relationships), the more inertia they gain.  
  The 30s are a critical window to establish habits and make changes that will define your future well-being.

- **You Define Your Life**  
  Everything is a result of your choices—what happens to you matters less than how you respond.  
  Don’t chase a lifestyle you can’t sustain; authenticity and consistency matter more than appearances.

> “If you never disappoint anyone, you’re only gonna disappoint yourself.”  
> “Respect is built by keeping promises, not impressing people.”  
> “You cannot outsource responsibility.”
